# GIBS

GNU Internet Backgammon Server

## Why

[FIBS](http://fibs.com/) no longer seems to support [CLIP](http://fibscompanion.sourceforge.net/fibs_interface.html) and is a single point of failure.
This project is an attempt to make it easy for anyone to host a backgammon server and community.

## Goals

- [GnuBG](http://www.gnubg.org/) backend
- WebSocket-based protocol for ease of implementing web and native clients
- Elo rating system
